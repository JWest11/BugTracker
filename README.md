# BugTracker
http://44.202.130.43/
A bug tracking website created with Flask and SQLite. Admins can create projects, assign users to the project, and create tickets (with varying properties, including user assignmet). Tickets can be commented on, have files uploaded to them, and track changes with a changelog. There are 3 tiers of security (Admin, Manager, Developer) with different permissions and views.
